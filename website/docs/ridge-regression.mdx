In order to address multicollinearity among many regressors and prevent
overfitting we apply a regularization technique to reduce variance at the cost
of introducing some bias. This approach tends to improve the predictive
performance of MMMs. The most common regularization, and the one we are using in
this code is Ridge regression. The mathematical notation for Ridge regression
is:

If we go a bit deeper into the actual components we will be using within the model specification,
besides the lambda penalization term above, we can identify the following formula:
