# [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/)
## Automated trend, seasonality and holiday effect decomposition

---

**Prophet** has been included in the code in order to improve the fit and forecast of
time-series by decomposing the effect of trend, seasonality and holiday
components in the response variable (Sales, conversions, etc.).

**Prophet** is a Facebook original procedure for **forecasting time
series** data, based on a model where **non-linear trends** are fit with yearly,
weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time
series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.
More details can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/).

## Prophet decomposition plot example
Trend, season, holiday and an extra regressor ("events" in this case) decomposition by Prophet.
Weekday is not used because the sample data is weekly (not daily).
Robyn uses Prophet to also decompose categorical variables as an extra regressor which can simplify later programming.
For technical details of decomposition, please refer to Prophet's documentation [here](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/trend_changepoints.html).
