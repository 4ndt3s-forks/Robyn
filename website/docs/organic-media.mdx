# Organic media

---

Robyn enables users to specify `organic_vars` to model marketing activities without direct spend. Typically, this may include newsletter, push notification, social media posts, among other efforts. Moreover, organic variables are expected to have similar carryover (adstock) and saturating behavior as paid media variables. The respective transformation techniques such as geometric or Weibull transformation for adstock; or Hill transformation for saturation, are also applied to organic variables.

### Examples of typical organic variables:
- Reach / Impressions on blog posts
- Impressions on organic & unpaid social media
- SEO improvements
- Email shots
- Reach on UGC

Below a chart showing the different types of organic variables that could be modeled
