# Calibration
## Aligning  with the ground-truth

### Calibration concept

By applying results from randomized controlled-experiments, you may improve the
accuracy of your marketing mix models dramatically. It is recommended to run
these on a recurrent basis to keep the model calibrated permanently. In general,
we want to compare the experiment result with the MMM estimation of a marketing
channel. Conceptually, this method is like a Bayesian method, in which we use
experiment results as a prior to shrink the coefficients of media variables. A
good example of these types of experiments is Facebook’s conversion lift tool
which can help guide the model towards a specific range of incremental values.

The figure illustrates the calibration process for one MMM candidate model.
[**Facebook’s Nevergrad gradient-free optimization platform**](https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/) allows us to include the **MAPE(cal,fb)** as a third optimization score besides Normalized Root Mean Square Error (**NRMSE**) and **decomp.RSSD** ratio (Please refer to the automated hyperparameter selection and optimization for further details) providing a set of **Pareto optimal model solutions** that minimize and converge to a set of Pareto optimal model candidates. This calibration method can be applied to other media channels which run experiments, the more channels that are calibrated, the more accurate the MMM model.
